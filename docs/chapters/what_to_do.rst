What to do with your results
============================

Once the script is finished running you can use the results to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).
An example of tool that can be used to perform this analysis is the online tool
`WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WEBGESTALT) <http://www.webgestalt.org/>`_, which is the tool used for the
analysis in our paper.
